# APIs on the Internet

An internet API is an abstract way of interacting with some set of data.

The owners of APIs usually control access to resources and actions via [authentication]() and [authorization]().

Examples of API models:

 - [graphql](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphQL)
 - [rest](@rest)
